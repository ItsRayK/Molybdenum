*PLAYER*
To run the Game (as Player):
  Run 'Player.java' as Java Application
   src > player > Player.java
   
The initial levels are in order of: puzzle, lightning, theme...
Only level 1 will be unlocked initially.
In order to unlock the next level, at least 1 star must be achieved in the previous level.

You can make edits to these levels or change them completely with the builder (See *BUILDER*)   
From player you can also play custom creations (See *BUILDER* on how to create one)
	In order to play a custom level you can click on "Custom Level" on the Level Select screen.
	You will be presented with a list of all custom levels to choose from.
	

  

*BUILDER*
To run the LevelBuilder (as Builder):
  Run 'Builder.java' as Java Application
   src > builder > Builder.java

When the builder is run, you will be presented with the option to create either a puzzle, lightning, or theme level
This will open a fresh builder view in which you need to set the parameters.

By setting the level name to "Level #" (i.e. Level 12) you can overwrite the existing level.
By setting the level name to anything that does not contain the word "Level" (i.e. Custom 2) you will be creating a brand new
	custom level which can be played when you return as the player.

Another option is to click on "Edit an Existing Level" in which you will be presented with a list of all of the saved levels.
	Selecting one will open the appropriate builder and fill all of the fields.

(You can overwrite any of the initial 15 levels as any type (i.e. you can build a Lightning Level and call it "Level 1", changing "Level 1" from Puzzle to Lightning.))

SAVE A LEVEL:
Levels will be saved by the name of what is set as the level name .txt (i.e. Level 3.txt)

DELETE A LEVEL:
You can delete any level from any builder. This will delete the file corresponding to the level name. (i.e. if Level name is "Level 3", Level 3.txt will be deleted)
It is recommended that you don't delete Levels 1-15, but rather change them.
